The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. The program that the Corner Grocer is asking to create should address the following three requirements for a given text-based input file that contains a list of purchased items for a single day:

Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

For this project I was capable of creating a program that ran successfully. The program was error free and conceise. The ability to write comments defining each function is in order with good coding practices. I could enhance my code by expanding my fluency in debugging codes. If my skills in debugging grows then my ability to problem solve and critical think through each line of code becomes faster and more efficient. The most challenging piece of the code to write was the histogram and the way I overcome this was through research. The skill from this project that will transfer to other projects or work are my research skills. Information was readily available. This program is maintanable and readable because of the comments throughout the program.
